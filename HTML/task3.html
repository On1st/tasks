    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
    
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by <em>tags</em>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called <em>tags</em> (and their <em>attributes</em>), character-based <em>data types</em>, <em>character references</em> and <em>entity references</em>. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent <em>empty elements</em> and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the <em>start tag</em>, and the second is the <em>end tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).</p>
    
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Empty elements like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> don't need a closing tag in HTML5.
    </div>
    
    <p>Another important component is the HTML <em>document type declaration</em>, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
    
    <h3>Example: "Hello, World!"</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
